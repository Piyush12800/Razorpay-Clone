# Razorpay Website Clone

This project is a clone of the Razorpay website, built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It aims to replicate the structure, layout, and design elements of the original website.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/piyush12800/razorpay-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd razorpay-clone
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn. If you don't have either of them installed, you can download and install npm from the official website: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Next, you need to configure Tailwind CSS. This project uses the PostCSS workflow to compile Tailwind CSS. Run the following command to generate the configuration file:
   ```
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

5. Open the generated `tailwind.config.js` file and customize the configuration based on your needs. You can refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation for more information: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration

6. Now, you can start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

7. The development server should now be running locally. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the Razorpay clone.
